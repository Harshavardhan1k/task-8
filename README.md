This project applies unsupervised learning using the K-Means clustering algorithm on the Mall Customer Segmentation dataset. The aim is to identify distinct groups of customers based on features such as Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score. The dataset is preprocessed and standardized to ensure uniformity before fitting the K-Means model. The optimal number of clusters is determined using the Elbow Method, and clusters are visualized using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for a 2D representation. To evaluate the clustering quality, the Silhouette Score is used. This project demonstrates practical techniques for customer segmentation and cluster evaluation using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
